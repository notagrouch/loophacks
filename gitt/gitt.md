# G.I.T.T. — Git Interactive Task Terminal

**Version:** v0.01  
**POSIX Compliant**  
**Author:** ogman (and the ghosts of sysadmins past)

---

## 📝 Purpose

GITT consolidates essential Git tasks into a fast, repeatable, portable interface.  
It’s designed for operators who value **clarity over cleverness** and **repeatability over rituals**.

This is not a teaching tool.  
It’s a **working tool** — for when the muscle memory of a thousand commands starts to betray you.  
For when the team needs to standardize actions without standardizing thought.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Two-column interactive menu, scaling from 1–20 commands.
- Enhanced repo status and branching visualizations.
- Common actions: pull, add, commit, push — streamlined.
- Recovery tools: soft reset, reflog, stash.
- Portable: `/bin/sh` compatible across macOS, Linux, BSD, WSL.
- Minimal dependencies. Maximal ergonomics.

## 💡 Philosophy

> _Tools should disappear. Workflows should persist._

GITT isn’t about making Git “easier.”  
It’s about **codifying clarity** so the operator can focus on outcomes, not syntax.  
Because even seasoned engineers forget flags and switches when they’re focused on the work.

This isn’t a shortcut.  
It’s a **discipline**.

## 🧠 Operational Principles

- **Standardize the tasks.**
- **Streamline the flow.**
- **Strengthen the outcomes.**

## 🔥 Why not just drag-and-drop?

_"bruh why"_  
_"ok but why tho"_  
_"can’t u just drag and drop lol"_

Yes. You can.  
But GITT exists for those who’ve outgrown the GUI rituals and need **repeatable, team-aligned actions** that endure beyond a single session or machine.

If you prefer the desktop app — _cool story bro._  
Go forth. This tool wasn’t built for you.

## 🕸 Footnote: The Solaris Vibe

While **Solaris** and its brethren may be relics to most, the **design ethos** survives here:  
**Composability. Clarity. Resilience.**  
Not everything should be "modern." Some things should just **work**.
